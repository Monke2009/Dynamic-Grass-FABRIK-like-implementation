Dynamic Grass (FABRIK-like Implementation)

After 2 years of competitive programming, I wanted to explore real-time simulation and physics-based animation using PyGame again.
This is my 11th small project, not perfect, but I’m starting to see progress in building interactive systems.

Update 0.1:
- Fixed grass flipped upside down
- More variation (thickness, height, grass color)
